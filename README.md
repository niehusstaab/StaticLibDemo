# StaticLibDemo
Demo of static lib w/ resources

Using Xcode 13.1

Notice that the `sample.json` resource is locatable in the compiled xcframework package, yet the code cant locate the resource from the bundle at runtime.

TODO: test with cocoapods too, to make sure compiled pod gets the resource bundle generated somehow
